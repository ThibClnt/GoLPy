# **GOLPY**

## Presentation

Golpy stands for "Game of Life in Python".
Far from the idea of creating a "new innovant python implementation of the Conways's Game of life", it is first an exercise, a good excuse to practice python for me.

## Controls

Use mouse wheel button to move/pan
Turn mouse wheel to zoom in/out
Left click to change a cell state

##Personalisation

You might want to change some settings as colors, size, etc.
It is possile to do this using the settings.py file.

## Dependencies

Golpy is created using tkinter and may also depends of PIL so make sure you have PIL installed on your python configuration before using GOLPY.

You may have tkinter by default. PIL can be installed via conda or pip commands.
